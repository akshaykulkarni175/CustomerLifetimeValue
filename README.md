# CustomerLifetimeValue
This project analyzes customer lifetime value (CLV) using a dataset of customer sales transactions. The analysis includes:
Key Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Calculation of customer tenure and origin year
CLV computation for different customer cohorts
Visualization of CLV trends over time

Insights

1) CLV increases significantly with customer tenure, highlighting the importance of customer retention

2) The 2013 customer cohort shows exceptionally high initial CLV

3) Long-term customers (48+ months) demonstrate the highest value, with CLV reaching $3,674 for the 2011 cohort

Implications

1) Focus on customer retention strategies, especially in the first 24 months

2) Investigate factors contributing to the high-value 2013 cohort

3) Develop targeted engagement strategies for different customer lifecycle stages

This analysis provides valuable insights for optimizing customer acquisition, retention, and overall business performance.
